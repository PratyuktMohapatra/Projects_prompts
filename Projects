  "project_name": "High Availability Database Setup for Monitoring Automation",
  "company_context": "Automation scripts were executed on approximately 550 applications for continuous monitoring. These scripts inserted data into a centralized MySQL standalone server.",
  "problem_statement": "The single MySQL server created a single point of failure, risking downtime and performance issues during high data load from automation scripts.",
  "objective": "Implement a high-availability and fault-tolerant database system to ensure continuous data ingestion and reporting availability.",
  "solution_implemented": {
    "database_cluster": "Installed and configured Percona XtraDB Cluster on three Virtual Machines (VMs) to achieve database high availability and data redundancy.",
    "load_balancing": "Configured HAProxy on two VMs to distribute database traffic and ensure failover capability.",
    "virtual_ip_setup": {
      "execution_database_vip": "Assigned one Virtual IP (VIP) for handling automation execution database writes.",
      "reports_database_vip": "Assigned another Virtual IP (VIP) for handling reporting database reads."
    },
    "performance_tuning": "Performed fine-tuning of Percona XtraDB Cluster parameters (such as buffer pool size, write set replication, and flow control) according to workload and performance requirements to optimize stability, throughput, and latency."
  },
  "improvements_over_standalone_mysql": {
    "availability": "Increased from approximately 90% uptime to 99.95% uptime, due to clustering and failover support.",
    "fault_tolerance": "Improved by nearly 100%, as node failures no longer cause downtime or data loss.",
    "read_write_performance": "Improved by around 40%, with parallel query handling and load balancing via HAProxy.",
    "data_consistency": "Achieved 100% real-time synchronization across all nodes using synchronous replication.",
    "maintenance_downtime_reduction": "Reduced planned maintenance downtime by approximately 85%, as operations can continue on other nodes."
  },
  "result": "Achieved high availability for both execution and reporting databases, eliminated single point of failure, and ensured stable data flow from automation scripts across 550 monitored applications.",

  "key_responsibilities": [
    "Configured and deployed Percona XtraDB Cluster across three VMs.",
    "Performed fine-tuning of cluster parameters based on workload and performance requirements.",
    "Set up HAProxy with dual VIP configuration for execution and reporting databases.",
    "Tested high-availability and failover scenarios to ensure reliability.",
    "Collaborated with automation team to verify continuous data ingestion after migration."
